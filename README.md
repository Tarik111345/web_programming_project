Frontend (Single Page App)

-The frontend is made as a single-page application using jQuery SPApp for routing. All pages load inside the main content without refreshing the whole page. Navigation works with hash URLs.

Pages included in this milestone:

-Home

-Products List

-Cart

-Checkout

-Dashboard

-Login

-Register

Bootstrap 5 is used for layout and responsiveness, so the design works on desktop and mobile.

What is finished in Milestone 1

-Project structure is separated into frontend and backend folders

-Each page is in a separate HTML file

-Navigation works without page reload

LocalStorage is used for:

-user registration

-login

-cart items

-dashboard data

-Navbar navigation works correctly

-Products are displayed with modals

-Cart and checkout work with basic simulation

-Login redirects to a simple user dashboard

ERD

The ERD is saved in a separate file called ERD.md.

Planned entities:

-Users

-Products

-Categories

-Orders
